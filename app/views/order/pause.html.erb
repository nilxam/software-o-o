      Due to the huge amount of requests we have to make a pause to make sure we can deliver
      the PromoDVDs. Yes, we are not a parcel service :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be an announcement on <a href='http://news.opensuse.org'>http://news.opensuse.org</a> when you can order
      DVDs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have an <b>urgent</b> request, an event with a close deadline, please send an email to marketing at opensuse.org.
